      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Finding a text selection is a basic operation of a Web browser, but the functionality is not exposed to Web developers. There are many different use cases for a custom mechanism for finding and navigating to a particular range of text in a Web document, such as [[!HTML5]] or [[!SVG]]. A developer may wish to design a webapp in which only the text in the active editing subtreee, and not the controls or other application text, is returned as a result of a search, overriding the native find-text functionality. A user may wish to highlight a particular passage, and link to it, even if that selection doesn't have a <code>id</code> attribute to serve as a fragment identifier. A designer may wish to find and style a range of text without changing the markup. A developer may wish to provide a particular text-matching algorithm for searching their specific type of content, to return more meaningful results (such as fuzzy matching or term substitution). A CMS developer may wish to allow advanced review and commenting on text selections for a collaborative document. All of these use cases share the a fundamental requirement for a API to find text.  
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many challenges to finding text in a modern Web document. 

        The content may have changed; the change could be a document restructuring, the addition of content before the target selection, or even a change to the target string itself. In dynamic documents, such as real-time collaborative editing webapps, the content may change during the same session as the selection; in linking or annotation scenarios, the state is lost between sessions, so other search and anchoring strategies must be used.

        Highly repetitive content, such as poetry or lyrics, may duplicate the same passage several times, making it difficult to indicate a specific instance of that passage.

        Large documents may have many possible matches, such that search-ahead mechanism may be computationally expensive. 

        In dynamic lazy-loaded (or “infinite-scroll”) content, the text being searched for may not have been loaded into the DOM yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also quirks in some native browser find-text mechanisms that could be improved through this API. For example, most current browsers do not let the user search for text across element boundaries (such as a string broken across different paragraphs or list items), which may be unintuitive and inconvenient to the end-user. Not all browsers allow the user to specify case-sensitive or whole-word search parameters, and not all browsers indicate the number of returned results. Browsers do not typically match language patterns that may be found in non-Latin character sets, including collapsed Unicode character sequences, optional diacritical marks, or similar features, such as matching <code>o</code> to <code>ó</code>, <code>ö</code>, <code>ø</code>, and <code>oe</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, a selection of a document may contain more than text, or no text at all. Such selections include a picture and its caption, the picture alone, a specific area of a picture, a point on a rendered map, or a range of time within timed media such as audio or video. Some of these examples can be fully expressed as a DOM range; others need supplementary characteristics, which may be application-specific, in order to be addressable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The RangeFinder API is intended to be flexible and performant. To ensure interoperability, this specification describes a default find-text algorithm, but this can be overriden by the developer. For flexibility in searches, this specification defines several parameterized selector methods, which can be applied in different ordered sequences to best match particular kinds of content, via method chaining, and provides a custom selector method that allows the developer to provide their own matching algorithm as a JavaScript function.

        For performance reasons, the RangeFinder API can be evoked iteratively, to find the next match in the document, rather than attempting to search the entire document for all matches.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result of a RangeFinder search is an object that contains the found range, any additional addressing characteristics, and a confidence interval to indicate how closely the search result matches the various selection criteria. By running a search multiple times and comparing the confidence interval for each result, a script can determine the best match for that set of search criteria. A script can also add or subtract selectors based on the results and confidence interval to refine a search.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        Should the return object also contain the CSS and/or XPath selector that is the closest match for the selection? Can you get that easily from another Web Platform feature?
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        This specification defines what is returned, but not the specific algorithms used to find that result, or the speed or optimizations taken. Such optimizations are implementation-specific.

          The RangeFinder Interface
        </h2>
        <p>
          This interface represents an object which allows for the discovery of arbitrary selections of a document based on criteria set out in its attributes. The constructor takes an optional property object to set the selecotr attributes. The results of the RangeFinder object's search are obtained through iterative execution of the <code>search()</code> method.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          Currently, this API uses attributes to set selectors. I considered using chaining setter methods, which would allow for multiple parameters for each selector, and specific confidence ratings for each selector. However, that approach wouldn't let you initialize the object with a property object, nor allow easy object introspection. Feedback welcome.

            Sets the current search index position as a range. This will be the starting point for future searches.

            If the <a>state</a> is <a>running</a>, suspends the search at the current search position of the document content. This may be helpful if the search is taking a long time, or if too many system resources are being consumed. The promise resolves when the system has re-acquired necessary system resources.

              This needs a lot of work to define. The most concrete evaluation currently is the edit distance, and even that needs a description of how that affects the confidence. “confidence” may be too loaded a term, too… maybe something less statistical, like “score”?

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        Poetry, lyrics, and some prose often include significant repetition. A simple find-text operation would return only the first instance of a repetition, while the selection in question might be for the second or third instance.
      </p>


      <section id="example-1" class="informative">
        <h3>Example 1</h3>
        <p>
          In the following poem, there are four instances of the phrase “<i>Rage, rage</i>”; the desired selection is the third instance. Assuming an HTML page consisting only of the poem, there are several ways to use the RangeFinder API to achieve this, a few of which are demonstrated below. Any or all of these techniques can be applied to ensure robust anchoring.

            <b>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</b>
            <p>by Dylan Thomas</p>
          </header>
          <p>
            Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
            Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
          </p>

          <p>
            Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
            Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
            Do not go gentle into that good night.
          </p>

          <p>
            Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
            Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
            And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
            Do not go gentle into that good night.
          </p>

          <p>
            Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
            Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
            <span class="highlight">Rage, rage</span> against the dying of the light.
          </p>

          <p>
            And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
            Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
            Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.    
          </p>

        <h4 id="ex1-m1">Method 1: Iterative search</h4>
        <pre class="example"><code>
var rf = new RangeFinder({ text: "Rage, rage" });
var result = rf.search(); // result is 1st instance of string
    result = rf.search(); // result is 2nd instance of string
    result = rf.search(); // result is 3rd instance of string, the target instance
        </code></pre>

        <h4 id="ex1-m2">Method 2: Context search with prefix</h4>
        <pre class="example"><code>
var rf = new RangeFinder({ text: "Rage, rage" });
    rf.prefix = "blaze like meteors and be gay, "; // the 32 characters preceding the selection
var result = rf.search(); // result is 1st instance of string after prefix
        </code></pre>

        <h4 id="ex1-m3">Method 3: Character count</h4>
        <pre class="example"><code>
var rf = new RangeFinder();
    rf.characterStart = 696; // the character count of the normalized textContent preceding the selection
    rf.characterLength = 11; // the character count of the selection
var result = rf.search(); // result is the 11 characters starting at the position 696
        </code></pre>

        <h4 id="ex1-m4">Method 4: Edit distance and query selector</h4>
        <pre class="example"><code>
var rf = new RangeFinder();
    rf.text = "Range, range"; // the selection, misspelled
    rf.editDistance = 2; // the Levenshtein distance tolerance between "Rage, rage" and "Range, range"
    rf.querySelector = "p:nth-of-type(5)"; // the 5th paragraph (the one containing the selection)
var result = rf.search(); // result is 1st instance of string starting at query selector, 
                          //   with a confidence reflecting the expected edit distance
        </code></pre>

        <h4 id="ex1-m5">Method 5: Element scope</h4>
        <p class="note">
          The main difference here between the <a>querySelector</a> attribute (used in <a href="#ex1-m4">Method 4</a>)
          and the <a>element</a> attribute is that <a>querySelector</a> sets the starting point for the search, 
          while <a>element</a> limits the scope. In other words, running <a>search()</a> again on the previous example
          will find the next instance in the next paragraph, while in this example, it will only find the single instance in the target paragraph.
        </p>
        <pre class="example"><code>
var rf = new RangeFinder();
    rf.text = "Rage, rage"; // the selection
    rf.element = document.querySelector("p:nth-of-type(5)"); // limit scope to the 5th paragraph
                                                             //   (the one containing the selection)
var result = rf.search(); // result is 1st instance of string within query selector, 
                          //   with a confidence reflecting the expected edit distance
        </code></pre>
